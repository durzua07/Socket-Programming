# Socket-Programming
Client and Server application using python that implements the following protocol: the client sends a computation request to the server which contains 10 double-precision floating point (real) numbers along with an integer that specifies the operation to be performed (OP_SUM=0, OP_MEAN=1, OP_MIN=2, OP_MAX=3). This application utilizes a simple REQUEST/RESPONSE protocol.
